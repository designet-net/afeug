								Our children move very long distances in search of safe clean water. It is really too painful for a young child to take very dirty water since such water is very dangerous to there health.<br> <br>

							<br>
							KS children Ministries has been having so many projects to help the orphans, boxers and the community but its hands are tied around so its plans normally stop at planning level. Among the many has got a poultry project which is aimed at empowering children, boxers and the community at large. This project will also raise more inflows which will help the organization to cater for some house requests, buying boxing equipment, paying gym rent, school tuition for children, through this we can also build our own house for the children (orphan home) To the community, KS will ensure that it employs some people to do casual work at a pay. <br> The organization will also train the interested community members free of charge to help them acquire the skills which will mean reliability, interested members will also benefit in such a way that they will buy eggs at a reduced price.  The waste products will be used as manure and itâ€™s widely on demand in Uganda thus ensuring sustainability of the project.
